  rules:
    Follow Discord's rules: "These include the [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and the [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms). Additionaly, message loggers and hidden channel viewers are forbidden. While we don't care if you choose to make your Discord client look pretty with client mods, both Discord's TOS and our community will not tolerate the use of message loggers and hidden channel viewers. This is not up for debate, and arguments about this subject will be dealt with accordingly."
    Follow our Code of Conduct: The [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies not only on GitHub but in all Prism Launcher community spaces. Those who do not intend to follow the Code of Conduct should not interact in Prism spaces.
    Listen to and respect all community team members: Please take requests from community team members seriously and listen when one asks you to do something. If you have a problem with what a team member is asking you to do, we advise that you step away from the situation and send a private message to another team member.
    Keep all activity legal, legitimate, and appropriate: We do not tolerate users breaking any laws, breaching a Terms of Service or an EULA, sexual content, or anything the moderators determine to be malicious or inappropriate.
    Don't spam and don't scam: No advertisement outside of the showcase channels. Also, no NFTs.
    Follow the given channel topic: Don't derail a discussion, and don't start conversations outside of the channel in which they're most appropriate. For example, if you start to get off-topic in an on-topic channel, ask other participants to move to an off-topic channel.
    When requesting help, specify all relevant information and provide error logs: Help us to help you! Without this information, we won't be able to help with your issue as easily or as quickly.
    Don't import drama or controversy from other communities: In these topics, emotions run high and opinions run even higher. To avoid arguments and other similar problems, simply avoid discussion of controversial topics from other communities.
    Leave other launcher developers alone: We will not tolerate bashing on the developers of other launchers, including those which we have forked from.
    Do not misuse accessibility tools: "[PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me) is here as aid for self identification purposes. Role-playing with PluralKit is not allowed."
